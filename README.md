This is an end-to-end data analytics project built using Python, MS SQL Server, and Power BI to understand customer behavior and revenue patterns. The project covers the complete data workflow, starting from raw data processing to final business-ready insights.

Python was used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature preparation. The cleaned data was then stored and managed in MS SQL Server, where SQL queries were used for validation and analysis. Finally, an interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize key metrics such as customer count, revenue, subscription impact, purchase frequency, demographics, and location-based performance.

The goal of this project is to transform raw customer data into actionable insights that help businesses improve decision-making, customer targeting, and revenue optimization.
